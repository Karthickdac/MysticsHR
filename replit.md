## Recruitment & Pre-Onboarding (Task #2)

- 7 DB tables: `job_requisitions`, `candidates`, `interview_rounds`, `interview_feedback`, `offer_letters`, `pre_onboarding_records`, `pre_onboarding_documents`
- Backend routes: `routes/recruitment.ts` and `routes/pre-onboarding.ts`. RBAC via `requireRole(...)` on all writes; reads gated by `requireHrmsUser`
- Offer acceptance auto-creates a `pre_onboarding_record` and seeds 9 default documents (Aadhaar, PAN, Bank, Photo, Educational, Experience, Relieving, Salary Slip, Address Proof)
- Document verify/reject auto-recomputes `completion_percentage` based on required documents verified
- Candidate stage auto-syncs when interviews are scheduled/completed and when offers are issued/accepted
- Source-of-hire enum values: LinkedIn, Naukri, Indeed, Referral, Walk-In, Campus, Agency, Company Website, Other

## Employee Master & Onboarding (Task #3)

- 8 DB tables: `employee_profiles`, `employee_education`, `employee_work_experience`, `employee_documents`, `employee_history`, `onboarding_checklists`, `onboarding_tasks`, `induction_sessions`
- Backend routes: `routes/employees-extended.ts` (profile, edu, work-exp, docs, history, bulk-import) and `routes/onboarding.ts` (checklists, tasks, induction, ID card)
- Field-level history logging on all profile/statutory updates (stored in `employee_history`)
- ID card generated as PDF using `pdf-lib` (no native deps); requires onboarding at 100%
- QR code on ID card via `qrcode` package (encodes employee ID + name + department)
- Bulk CSV import: accepts `rows` array of key-value objects; skips duplicates by email; returns `{imported, skipped, errors[]}`
- Onboarding checklist auto-seeds 10 default tasks across 4 categories: HR (3), IT (3), Department (2), Employee (2)
- Completion % = (completed tasks / total tasks) × 100

## Leave & Permission Management (Task #5)

- 7 DB tables: `leave_types`, `leave_balances`, `leave_applications`, `leave_accrual_history`, `blackout_dates`, `permission_applications`, `permission_registers`
- Backend routes: `routes/leave.ts` (leave type CRUD, application workflow, balance tracking, calendar, blackout dates) and `routes/permissions.ts` (permission applications, monthly register, HR override)
- Leave types configurable: CL, SL, EL, Maternity/Paternity, Comp-Off, Bereavement, Marriage, and custom types with annual quota, carry-forward, encashment, advance notice, HOD/HR approval flags
- Multi-level approval: Employee → HOD → HR Manager (configurable per leave type via requiresHodApproval/requiresHrApproval flags)
- Policy validations: balance check (LOP warning flow), advance notice, blackout date overlap, duplicate application overlap
- Leave balances initialize via `POST /leave/balances/initialize`; available = allocated + carryForward - used - pending
- Permission monthly limit defaults to 240 minutes (4hrs); enforced on submission; HR can override per-employee per-month
- Permission approval auto-updates `permission_registers.usedMinutes`; cancellation restores balance
- All mutations wrapped in `db.transaction()` for atomicity; state-machine guards prevent re-processing
- HOD scope: HOD can only action requests from employees in their department (403 otherwise)
- Frontend pages: `/leave` (apply + balance summary + my applications), `/leave/types` (HR config), `/leave/calendar` (team calendar + blackout dates), `/leave/approvals` (HOD/HR queue + balance init), `/permissions` (apply + monthly register + HR override)

## Attendance & Shift Management (Task #4)

- 6 DB tables: `shift_templates`, `shift_assignments`, `shift_swaps`, `attendance_records`, `attendance_regularizations`, `overtime_records`
- Backend routes: `routes/shifts.ts` (templates, assignments, swaps) and `routes/attendance.ts` (daily records, override, regularization workflow, summary, overtime)
- Shift types: Fixed, Flexible, Rotational, Night Shift
- Attendance statuses: Present, Absent, Half-Day, On Leave, On Permission, Holiday, Week Off, Regularization Pending
- Overtime auto-calculated when totalMinutesWorked > minWorkingHoursMinutes + overtimeThreshold; overtime record created automatically
- Regularization workflow: Employee submits → HOD reviews (Approve/Reject) → on Approve, times applied to attendance_records
- Shift swap workflow: Employee requests → HOD approves/rejects → HR approves/rejects (both steps required)
- HR override: Any HR role can override sign-in/out/status on any attendance record; `overrideReason` is required; flagged with `isHrOverride=true`
- Employee self-service: `/api/employees/:id/attendance` enforces ownership check (employee can only view own records)
- Shift calendar endpoint generates per-day entries from active shift assignments, merged with attendance status for that day
- Monthly summary aggregates counts per status per employee; CSV export on frontend

## Performance Management & ESS Portal (Task #7)

- 6 DB tables: `performance_cycles`, `performance_goals`, `goal_progress`, `self_appraisals`, `manager_evaluations`, `appraisal_outcomes`
- Backend routes: `routes/performance.ts` — cycles CRUD, advance-stage, goal CRUD, progress updates, self-appraisals (upsert), manager evaluations (upsert), calibration view with weighted scoring, outcome computation, ESS `/me` profile and dashboard
- Cycle stages: Goal Setting → Mid Review → Self Appraisal → Manager Evaluation → Calibration → Completed (advance-stage API increments stage)
- Cycle types: Annual, Semi-Annual, Quarterly; statuses: Draft, Active, Closed
- Goals (KRA/KPI): cycleId, employeeId, title, weightage (%), targetValue, measurementMethod, status; latest progress percent joined on list
- Calibration view aggregates self/manager scores per goal weighted by goal weightage; outcome labels: Outstanding, Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, Needs Improvement, Unsatisfactory
- `computeAppraisalOutcomes` deletes and re-inserts outcomes for the cycle using manager rating (or self rating fallback) × goal weightage
- ESS portal: GET/PUT `/ess/me` (employee profile + emergency contact self-update), GET `/ess/dashboard` (attendance summary, leave balances, active goals, recent payslip)
- Frontend pages: `/performance` (cycles dashboard + quick-nav), `/performance/goals` (KRA/KPI list with progress bars + assign modal), `/performance/appraisals` (self-rating with star UI), `/performance/evaluations` (manager ratings for team), `/performance/calibration` (score matrix + outcome computation), `/ess` (3-tab hub: Dashboard / My Profile / Services)
- Role gates: HR creates cycles, HOD+ assigns goals, all roles access ESS, HR-only calibration

### Task #9: Exit & Offboarding + Reporting & Analytics
- DB tables: `exit_requests`, `exit_clearance_tasks`, `fnf_computations`, `exit_interviews`, `report_schedules`, `saved_report_templates`
- Backend routes: `routes/exit.ts` (resignations, clearance CRUD, FnF dual-approval, exit interviews, auto-issue documents) and `routes/reports.ts` (8 pre-built reports, analytics dashboard, custom runner, scheduler CRUD, template CRUD)
- Notice period: <1yr=30 days, <3yr=60 days, else=90 days (calculated from DOJ)
- Auto-clearance tasks generated across IT/Finance/HR/Manager when status changes to "Clearance Pending"
- FnF requires dual approval (HR + Finance). On full approval: status→"FnF Approved", auto-issues Relieving Letter + Experience Certificate via `issuedDocumentsTable`
- Analytics: headcount, attrition rate, avg attendance, open positions KPIs + 6-month headcount trend + department distribution (Recharts)
- 8 pre-built reports: Employee Directory, Attendance Summary, Leave Utilization, Payroll Register, Headcount, Attrition, Performance Summary, Recruitment Pipeline
- Custom report builder: field picker + column selector + saved templates CRUD
- Report scheduler: CRON-based schedule CRUD (frequency: daily/weekly/monthly, format: CSV/PDF/Excel)
- Frontend pages: `/exit` (list + KPIs + initiate modal), `/exit/:id` (status flow + clearance checklist + FnF compute/approve + exit interview), `/analytics` (KPI cards + Recharts charts), `/reports` (3-tab: Catalog + Custom Builder + Scheduler)
- Role gates: All roles see exit; Analytics + Reports restricted to HR roles + HOD + payroll_admin

### Task #8: Helpdesk Ticketing + Document Generation
- DB tables: `helpdesk_tickets`, `ticket_comments`, `ticket_sla_logs`, `document_templates`, `issued_documents`
- Enum: `hrDocumentTypeEnum` (pg `hr_document_type`) — offer_letter, appointment_letter, experience_letter, salary_certificate, noc, increment_letter, relieving_letter, custom
- Backend routes: `/helpdesk` (CRUD + comments + SLA tracking + report) and `/documents` (templates CRUD + PDF generation via pdf-lib + download)
- SLA hours: Urgent=4, High=8, Medium=24, Low=48. Priority change resets SLA deadline.
- PDF generation: pdf-lib with `{{fieldName}}` substitution. Auto-fields: employeeName, employeeCode, dateOfJoining, lastWorkingDay, currentDate
- Frontend pages: `/helpdesk` (dashboard + create ticket + filters), `/helpdesk/ticket/:id` (detail + comments + status/priority controls), `/documents` (templates list + generate modal + issued documents)
- Role gates: Employees see own tickets; HOD sees team; HR unrestricted. Template management is HR-only. Internal comments restricted to MANAGER_ROLES.

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec (NOTE: after running, manually ensure lib/api-zod/src/index.ts only has `export * from "./generated/api"`)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)

## Important Notes

- Orval codegen regenerates `lib/api-zod/src/index.ts` with duplicate exports. After every codegen run, ensure it only contains: `export * from "./generated/api";`
- The orval config intentionally omits `schemas: { type: "typescript" }` to prevent TypeScript type conflicts
- All protected routes use `requireAuth` middleware that checks Clerk auth
- Audit logs are written automatically on CRUD operations
- Demo data: 5 departments, 8 designations, 8 employees (seeded via SQL)
